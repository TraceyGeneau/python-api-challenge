# My Python API Challenge Experience

## Introduction

Greetings! This repository encapsulates my journey through the Python API Challenge, a captivating exploration into the world of weather data analysis. Leveraging the power of Python, the `citipy` library, and the OpenWeatherMap API, I embarked on a quest to visualize and interpret weather patterns across more than 500 cities worldwide.

### Project Highlights

#### Part 1: WeatherPy

The initial segment, meticulously documented in the `WeatherPy.ipynb` Jupyter notebook, encapsulates my endeavors in fulfilling two core requirements:

**Requirement 1: Creating Plots to Showcase Weather-Latitude Relationships**

With the assistance of the OpenWeatherMap API, I retrieved and analyzed weather data for a diverse range of cities. The subsequent creation of scatter plots unveiled fascinating relationships between latitude and key weather variables like `Temperature`, `Humidity`, `Cloudiness`, and `Wind Speed`.

**Requirement 2: Computing Linear Regression for Each Relationship**

Delving deeper into the dataset, I computed linear regressions for each relationship. The plots were intelligently categorized into Northern and Southern Hemispheres based on latitude. To streamline the process, I crafted a function, ensuring that the scatter plots not only presented data points but also featured the essential elements of linear regression â€“ the line, the model's formula, and the `r` values.

### Getting Started

The following plots were created:

- Northern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude
- Southern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude
- Northern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude
- Southern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude
- Northern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude
- Southern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude
- Northern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude
- Southern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude

#### Discussion about the linear relationship:

The R squared value for the Northn Hemisphere data was 0.60 and the R squarred for the Southern Hemisphere was 0.61. Both models had a moderate amount of variance with the Northern Hemisphere showing slightly higher varience. This makes perfect sense as there are many factors besides latitude that would affect the temperature of any location. Some examples would include approximate distance from water bodies, altitude, presence of wind, cloudiness or weather.

From the equation of the line we can see that the slope is positive for the Southern Hemisphere as it approaches the equator (0) and negative in the Northern Hemisphere as it approaches the Equator. Both of these slopes make complete sense because the temperature as one moves from the poles into the equator will be warmer.

Also, the larger slope in the Southern Hemisphere indicates a quicker change in temperature as one approaches the equator but it does not reach as high of a maximum temperature (25-35C) as it reaches the equator, whereas the Northern Hemisphere warms up at a slower rate but sees a higher maximum temperatures closer to the equator (30-40C).

#### Discussion about the linear relationship:

The linear regression results and the slope for both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres indicated that there was too much variation in the data to show any correlation between the latitude and humidity. The slow for both indicated a slight slope that is almost not present. In the case of the Southern Hemisphere it increased at a slper of 0.02 towards the equator but in the case of the Northern Hemisphere, the slope increased as the distance moved away from the equator.

Although further analysis of data would need to be carried out, based on this data alone, there are too many factors that affect the humidity of an area to say it is just based on latitude alone.

### Cloudiness vs. Latitude Linear Regression Plot

#### Discussion about the linear relationship:

The cloudiness in the Nothern Hemisphere appears to have a relatively low R squared value. As can be observed form the data and the line of regression (slope = 0.02) the relationship between Cloudiness and Latitude has a lot of variation coming from other factors.

In the Southern Hemisphere the data indicates a slight increase (slope =0.36) in cloudiness as the Latitude approaches the equator. The R squared is relatively low indicating there is a large amount of variation that is likely caused by other sources.

### Wind Speed vs. Latitude Linear Regression Plot

#### Discussion about the linear relationship:

The variation in the wind speed results for each lattitude in the Northern Hemisphere resulted in an R squared of 0.0002. The consistency in the wind speeds at all lattitudes is quite impressive.

In the Southern Hemisphere the R squared (0.030) also indicated that variation at each lattitude was high. There was a very slight decrease in Wind Speed as the results approached the equator (0).

Interestingly, the wind speed in the Northern Hemisphere concentrated between 0 and 10 m/s (with some values outside of this range of course, where as the winds in the Southern Hemisphere were concentrated between 0-7 (m/s).

It would be interested to determine if there were significant differences in the data sets.

## Part 2: VacationPy

In this deliverable, you'll use your weather data skills to plan future vacations. Also, you'll use Jupyter notebooks, the `geoViews` Python library, and the Geoapify API.

The code needed to import the required libraries and load the CSV file with the weather and coordinates data for each city created in Part 1 is provided to help you get started.

Your main tasks will be to use the Geoapify API and the `geoViews` Python library and employ your Python skills to create map visualizations.

To succeed on this deliverable of the assignment, open the `VacationPy.ipynb` starter code and complete the following steps:

1. Create a map that displays a point for every city in the `city_data_df` DataFrame as shown in the following image. The size of the point should be the humidity in each city.

2. Narrow down the `city_data_df` DataFrame to find your ideal weather condition. For example:

- A max temperature lower than 27 degrees but higher than 21
- Wind speed less than 4.5 m/s
- Zero cloudiness

**NOTE**: Feel free to adjust your specifications but make sure to set a reasonable limit to the number of rows returned by your API requests.

3. Create a new DataFrame called `hotel_df` to store the city, country, coordinates, and humidity.

4. For each city, use the Geoapify API to find the first hotel located within 10,000 meters of your coordinates.

5. Add the hotel name and the country as additional information in the hover message for each city on the map as in the following image:
